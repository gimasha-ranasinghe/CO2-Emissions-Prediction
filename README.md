# CO2-Emissions-Prediction
CO2 Emissions Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression

This project is a lab exercise completed as part of the Machine Learning with Python course by IBM. It demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict CO2 emissions based on vehicle characteristics.

Project Overview
In this project, I use Simple Linear Regression to analyze and predict the CO2 emissions from vehicles. The model uses ENGINESIZE and FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB as the independent variables to estimate CO2 emissions, helping to understand the relationship between a carâ€™s engine size and fuel consumption and its environmental impact.
